## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned >> Continued development

I thought I was done with css, not everything though but yeah, the basics. This project made me realize I needed to learn about css grid, flexbox (although I've got knowledge on this but yeah, flexbox) and then responsiveness, especially when resizing it to desktop view coding on phone. Knowing the right height and width to use, if it should be in %, px, em or vh, man its frustrating! Ps: I really need to go back!ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜·


```css
@media (min-width:375px) {
  flex-wrap:wrap;
}
```

I want to thank my friend Walter for helping me out with the desktop view. He's been helping me out with it in my last projects and I'm grateful to him for that.
